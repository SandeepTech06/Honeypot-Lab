# SSH Honeypot Project (Cowrie)

## Overview
This project demonstrates deployment of a Cowrie SSH honeypot to monitor and analyze attacker behavior.

I deployed a Cowrie SSH honeypot on Kali Linux to simulate a vulnerable server. I performed attack simulations and analyzed logs to capture commands, login attempts, and session activity to understand attacker behavior.

## Features
- Fake SSH server
- Login attempt capture
- Command logging
- Real-time monitoring

## Tools
Kali Linux, Python, Cowrie

## Demo
Simulated brute force attack and command execution.

## Learning Outcome
Understanding attacker tactics and threat monitoring.
