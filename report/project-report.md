# SSH Honeypot Lab (Cowrie)

## Objective
To deploy a high-interaction SSH honeypot to capture and analyze attacker behavior.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Cowrie Honeypot
- Python
- SSH

## Methodology
1. Installed Cowrie honeypot
2. Configured SSH service
3. Simulated brute force login
4. Captured attacker commands
5. Analyzed logs

## Findings
- Multiple login attempts recorded
- Commands like ls, whoami executed
- IP address captured
- Honeypot successfully simulated vulnerable system

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates real-world attack monitoring and helps understand attacker techniques.

## Future Improvements
- Add dashboard visualization
- Deploy on cloud
- GeoIP tracking
